# Amazon clone project
we built a web application that emulates the basic functionalities of the Amazon website, including browsing, adding and removing items from a shopping cart, and checking out. To achieve this, we used various tools and technologies such as `React, React Context API (with reducers), MaterialUI, and react-currency-format.`

## `React` 
React is a JavaScript library that allows us to build reusable and scalable UI components, making the development process faster and more efficient. We used React in this project to create the main components of our web application, such as the product listing, shopping cart, and checkout pages.

## `React Context API`
It is a state management tool that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. We used Context API in conjunction with reducers to manage the application state, including the shopping cart items and user information.


## `MaterialUI`
It is a popular React component library that provides a set of pre-built UI components and styles that can be easily customized and integrated into React applications. We used MaterialUI in this project to create the layout and styling of our web application, such as the navigation bar, buttons, and form fields.


## `react-currency-format`
Finally, we used react-currency-format to format the currency values displayed in our application, such as the prices of products and the total amount in the shopping cart. This tool provided an easy and flexible way to format the currency values according to our desired format, such as adding a prefix or thousand separators.

Overall, by using these tools and technologies, we were able to build a functional and user-friendly Amazon clone that demonstrates the power and flexibility of modern web development tools.


### `npm start` to run the app.
